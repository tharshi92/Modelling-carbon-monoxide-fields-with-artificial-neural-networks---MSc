%% ut-thesis.tex -- document template for graduate theses at UofT

%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass{ut-thesis}

%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

%% *** NOTE ***
%% Put here all other formatting commands that belong in the preamble.
%% In particular, you should put all of your \newcommand's,
%% \newenvironment's, \newtheorem's, etc. (in other words, all the
%% global definitions that you will need throughout your thesis) in a
%% separate file and use "\input{filename}" to input it here.


%% *** Adjust the following settings as desired. ***

%% List only down to subsections in the table of contents;
%% 0=chapter, 1=section, 2=subsection, 3=subsubsection, etc.
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}

%% Make each page fill up the entire page.
\flushbottom
%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
Current techniques for inverse modeling carbon monoxide emissions have large biases due to errors in atmospheric transport and tracer gas chemistry in atmospheric models. In addition, current observations used to constrain emissions on regional scales suffer from limited data and low precision measurements. Even with the multiple data stream approach, the covariances between different datasets can be challenging to quantify. A statistical approach offers a means of inverse modeling atmospheric carbon monoxide while avoiding the challenges of model errors We examine the use of a statistical model to simulate atmospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide via feed forward neural networks. This is a a necessary first step toward the use of such networks for the inverse modeling of carbon monoxide emissions. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model is used to train the network. We show that a maximally connected network with a single hidden layer is sufficient to fit a time series of carbon monoxide concentrations over New York City.
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%%\begin{dedication}
%%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
%\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

Many thanks to Professor Dylan Jones for teaching a \textbf{dope} introductory class on data assimilation, and for taking me under his supervision. I look forward to our continued collaboration over the length of my doctoral training.

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents
\listoftables
\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%
